      Rediscover Life Through Food
    </h2>
    <p>
      What if your food habits could reveal your life habits?<br><br>
            At the core of our project, we believe that how we approach food reflects how we navigate stress, emotion, and meaning.<br><br>
            Through the three cycles of eating&mdash;before, during, and after&mdash;and three driving forces&mdash;desire, routine, ethos&mdash;we uncover nine food personalities.<br><br>
            Each one holds clues to your emotional resilience, ecological sensitivity, cognitive control, and self-awareness.<br><br>
            In a world where urban living strips food down to function, re-encountering the full cycle of food&mdash;from selection to savoring, from waste to soil&mdash;is an act of rewilding our human experience.<br><br>
            We don&rsquo;t just reveal where your pressure points are.<br>
            We offer you a way back:<br>
            starting from a worm bin, a seed, a bite&mdash;<br>
            to feel again the slow, powerful, living cycle you are part of.
